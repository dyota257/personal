                        p Point location data was given of ships (~1.4M points). Point locations were also given, that define the lay of a subsea pipeline. The task was to count how many times ships "cross" the pipeline, along with the angle of crossing (between 0 and 90 degrees).

                        p The end deliverable was a summary table of counts, per kilometer section of pipeline, and a map that displayed the ship travel paths and the pipeline. 
                        p Everything was executed using only Microsoft Excel, primarily Power Query. Some Visual Basic for Excel was used to assist in formatting charts.
