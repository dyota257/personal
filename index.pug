                        p This project has two distinct but related parts: #[b scoreboard], and #[b tournament manager].
                        p The scoreboard is composed of a countdown timer and a score counter for two players. There are two interactions with database: picking up names from fixtures to display on the scoreboard, and posting match results back to database upon match completion. 
                        p The tournament manager is mainly concerned with displaying fixtures. Using the tournament manager applicaton, the tournament organiser can copy and paste in fixtures from the Excel source into a text input field, and send the fixtures to the database. Users can scan a QR code, which allows them to view the fixtures.
                        p This replaces a past workflow where fixtures needed to be formatted for print, have multiple copies printed out during the proceeding of the tournament, have the copies taken to the walls of the tournament hall, and participants would need to crowd around to check when their match is due.

                        p Point location data was given of ships (~1.4M points). Point locations were also given, that define the lay of a subsea pipeline. The task was to count how many times ships "cross" the pipeline, along with the angle of crossing (between 0 and 90 degrees).
                        p After reducing the dataset, point location data were converted into vectors (comprised of two points each). For every kilometer of the pipeline, every ship vector was examined to see if it intersected that one-kilometer section.
                        p The end deliverable was a summary table of counts, per kilometer section of pipeline, and a map that displayed the ship travel paths and the pipeline. 
                        p Everything was executed using only Microsoft Excel, primarily Power Query. Some Visual Basic for Excel was used to assist in formatting charts.

Description were filled out in .docx, and outcomes of risk workshops were tabulated in .xlsx. Users needed to consult the company procedure or refer to the global QHSE manager for guidance. The management of the process itself was done through an Excel sheet (recording titles, unique ID numbers to MOCs, etc. )
                        p This app was a digital manifestation of the same process. Numbering to new MOCs was automatically assigned, and registering of MOC register was kept up to date automatically. Practical usage of the tool was guided through on-screen prompts, and the user journey through the process was guided by the application logic itself.

                            p Weekly reporting is expected early in the week. Source data needs to be downloaded from reporting system and composed into a report manually in Excel. Due to limitations of processing in Excel, time is also taken up downloading large reports to enable the correct lookups. The processing time is also compounded by having to work with four different files. The report is usually received via email by leadership on Wednesday or Thursday, and does not leave enough time to course-correct.
