            <summary>Corporate management of change form digitalisation</summary>
            <p>A management of change process, used to recording administrative changes at a corporate level, had existed, and was carried out using documents in .docx and .xlsx. Description were filled out in .docx, and outcomes of risk workshops were tabulated in .xlsx. Users needed to consult the company procedure or refer to the global QHSE manager for guidance. The management of the process itself was done through an Excel sheet (recording titles, unique ID numbers to MOCs, etc. )</p>
            <p>This app was a digital manifestation of the same process. Numbering to new MOCs was automatically assigned, and registering of MOC register was kept up to date automatically. Practical usage of the tool was guided through on-screen prompts, and the user journey through the process was guided by the application logic itself. </p>
