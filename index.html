            <summary>PowerShell script to download data from a web API for ingestion into Power BI (2021)</summary>
            <p>This was a workaround, to compensate for a web request from inside a Power BI dataset that failed to authorise in Power BI Service (further details are outlined <a href="https://dyota257.bearblog.dev/powershell-download-data/">here</a>).</p>
            <p>This was a PowerShell script that made use of Invoke-WebRequest to hit an API endpoint, download the JSON data, and save it into a file. The file is saved to a SharePoint location so that it is accessible to the Power BI report. </p>
            <p>This was automated by creating a shortcut in the Startup folder in Windows. The target for the shortcut contains command-line commands to run the PowerShell script. Thus, the data is downloaded every time the computer is started up. </p>

            <summary>Count of number of times ships in a shipping channel travel across subsea pipeline, with angles of crossing (2021)</summary>
            <p>Point location data was given of ships (~1.4M points). Point locations were also given, that define the lay of a subsea pipeline. The task was to count how many times ships "cross" the pipeline, along with the angle of crossing (between 0 and 90 degrees).</p>
            <p>After reducing the dataset, point location data were converted into vectors (comprised of two points each). For every kilometer of the pipeline, every ship vector was examined to see if it intersected that one-kilometer section.</p>
            <p>The end deliverable was a summary table of counts, per kilometer section of pipeline, and a map that displayed the ship travel paths and the pipeline. </p>
            <p>Everything was executed using only Microsoft Excel, primarily Power Query. Some Visual Basic for Excel was used to assist in formatting charts. </p>

            <summary>Real estate web scraper in Node.js and Excel Power Query (2020)</summary>
            <p>This is a compound tool, using Node.js in the command line and Excel. Upon executing, the JS script will hits a list of URLs on domain.com.au for the home open inspections happening in the next Saturday and Sunday, and list them (along with all the house attributes) in a .csv file. </p>
            <p>The .csv file is then ingested into a Excel file through Power Query, where it is presented as a table. </p>

            <summary>Electronic business card with QR code to save contact details</summary>
            <p>A phone-size, single-screen app that mimics the layout of the corporate business card, with a prominent QR code. Upon scanning the code with the camera of a smartphone, the phone will pick up all contact data (name, email, phone number, job title etc.) to be saved in the address book.</p>
            <p>QR code is a HTML textbox with a single <code>&ltimg&gt </code>tag. The source is an API call to a third party API that converts strings into QR codes. The string passed in as a parameter is the contact details in the vCard protocol format. </p>

            <summary>Corporate management of change form digitalisation</summary>
            <p>A management of change process, used to recording administrative changes at a corporate level, had existed, and was carried out using documents in .docx and .xlsx. Description were filled out in .docx, and outcomes of risk workshops were tabulated in .xlsx. Users needed to consult the company procedure or refer to the global QHSE manager for guidance. The management of the process itself was done through an Excel sheet (recording titles, unique ID numbers to MOCs, etc. )</p>
            <p>This app was a digital manifestation of the same process. Numbering to new MOCs was automatically assigned, and registering of MOC register was kept up to date automatically. Practical usage of the tool was guided through on-screen prompts, and the user journey through the process was guided by the application logic itself. </p>
